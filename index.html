        <p>In the realm of code, where bytes align,<br>
            A love story unfolds, both rare and divine.<br>
            Lines of syntax whisper, in languages sweet,<br>
            In the binary dance, our hearts find their beat.<br>
            
            In the matrix of pixels, where pixels entwine,<br>
            Your love is the variable, constant and fine.<br>
            Our connection's encrypted, a secure delight,<br>
            In the algorithm of love, you're my byte-sized light.<br>
            
            Your smile, a subroutine, runs deep in my core,<br>
            A loop of affection, forevermore.<br>
            In the server of dreams, where emotions compile,<br>
            Our love's an upgrade, with every byte and file.<br>
            
            You're the exception to my try-catch heart,<br>
            A debugging touch, making errors depart.<br>
            Together we navigate, in this vast cyber sea,<br>
            Two souls entwined in perfect synergy.<br>
            
            In the binary sunset, where our avatars glow,<br>
            Our love's the program, never-ending, aglow.<br>
            In the language of love, you're the syntax I find,<br>
            A beautiful code, forever in my mind.<br>
            
            So here's to us, in this digital space,<br>
            Where love transcends, leaving no trace.<br>
            In the binary moonlight, our romance unfurls,<br>
            A love story written in the code of ones and zeros.</p>
